## The Emails Lab

This is a digitized version of the email lab from ENSI, J. Loundagin, L. Flammer, and/or J. Lederman (see the "Licensing & Attribution" section for a full citation).

(TODO: EXPLAIN LAB'S PURPOSE/ETC. HERE)

## How to Download & Use This Project

Above & to the right of the document list above this text, you should see a green "Code" button. If you click it, it should open a menu with a few options; if you're inexperienced with git, you'll probably want to choose "Download ZIP."

Once you've downloaded the files, all you'll have to do is upload them to whatever webhosting site you plan on using. I'm assuming whatever service you're using will have instructions on how to do so, so I'll leave the uploading up to you.

I do not own any of the original lab material, including the instructions (including both the general lab structure and the actual wording of the instructions) and the email materials. I only take credit for adapting it for online use.[^1]

[^1]: As for licensing my work on this project, rest assured that after spending several hours researching licenses I have come to the conclusion that I don't really care what you do with it, so long as:
- You don't sue me
- If you break anything, you don't make *me* fix it (I have enough problems fixing my own bugs, I'm not solving yours)
- You don't use the code for evil
- If you do end up using the code for evil, for the love of god don't do anything worse than wipe my name from all the documents, claim "I made this," and then charge ludicrous prices for it.
- Crediting me would be nice, but don't feel too bad if you forget. We all make mistakes :)
